<p>I am a final year student of Bachelors of Engineering (Information and Communication Technology) and Diploma in Software Engineering Practice at University of Technology Sydney. It is a five year programme. While I have a comprehensive background in engineering, I have Information and Communication Technology as my major subject with lots of exposure to software development. I am interested in applying for the subject position. I have professional IT experience working with ThankQ Solutions (a Software Development firm), Dsgnlb (a digital graphics design company) as a Developer as well as a Quality Assurance inspector. It has provided me skills to deal with my clients and support them in the project. I helped my team them in designing, creating a checklists of objectives/corrections for designers and ensuring that the Developers review their work before handing it over to Client.</p>
