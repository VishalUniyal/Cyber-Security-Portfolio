  <h3 class="mb-5">Experience</h3>
   <p class="text-justify">I am a final year International Student of Bachelors of Engineering in ICT and Software Engineering at University of Technology Sydney (UTS). 
        I am in a five-year Engineering Degree programme to include Diploma in Engineering Practice. As a student I am still finding my career "End Goal",
        and I like familiarising myself with multiple disciplines of computer Software and Security. </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
        I have experience of working for software companies as an Application/Website Developer and Quality Assurance - Internship.
        I worked on Developing/Testing the structure of the website and automating processes. I collaborated with team and especially the client to deliver solutions to their problems.</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Cyber Security as a career is something I look forward to. Now Cyber Security is a big aspect of our lives and also for businesses that rely on digital markets.
        I have studied subject like Fundamentals of Security, Cyber Security and Digital Forensics which were very interesting and helped me familiarise with some of the 
        widely used offensive security tools and types of attacks. I got to use Kali Linux where I got to use tools like Metasploit, Aircrack-ng and Nmap.</p>

        <p style="font-weight:bold">From the Cyber Security Summer Studios Classes I wish to : </p>
        <p>1. Develop me technical knowledge  and Analytical skills on Cyber Security Issues</p>
        <p>2. Collaborate with my team and gain knowledge from experienced veterans of Cyber Security fields</p>
        <p>3. Reflect of my skills and improve on them from over time</p>

        <p>3. Being punctual the classes and submitting assessments on time.</p>
        <p>4. Introducing some subject related tools that I used during my internship to classmates Like Visual studio code and easy local live server setup.</p>
        <p>5. Implementing design thinking and continuously improving myself as per subject criteria</p>

        <br>

        <p style="font-weight:bold">The Learning outcomes after successful completion of this subject -- <b> Subject learning objectives (SLOs) :</b></p>
        <p> 1. Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem or scope a defined problem.</p>
        <p> 2. Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.</p>
        <p> 3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The First week Of Summer Studios was really great, This one of the few subjects in my 
            degree where I enjoy learning and collaborating with teammates. Almost everyone knew each other in the class,
            but they welcomed me into their group. I ended up joining a group with mixed major backgrounds but we all share the same goal, 
            to get most of our Cyber Security classes, get a job in this field and have enjoy our tutorial classes.
            I am happy to be around with very experienced veterans who are also from UTS Cyber Security Society like Jason in my team and also
            members from other groups are also very helpful. Tutors of our class are very experienced individuals and the knowledge give us
            about the subject are very informative and intriguing.

         IMAGE 1 : We created our Sprint group on Microsoft teams using Microsoft Sprint Board to Allot task to group members for the 1st Presentation.

        <h5>SLOs 1 & 4</h5>
        <br>
        <p class="text-justify">Microsoft Teams acted as like a Agile methodology board where we set and assign tasks to people involved in the scrum. 
            We added links to the topics we can prepare our presentation on and the comments with links to the presentation for easy access
          to others. We had problems deciding the topics and allotting time for each member to contribute speaking on the presentation. In the 
          end we decided to take up Bug Bounty, Arthem Mackwosky who is a Bug Bounty hunter gets paid for finding flaws in steam frameworks.
          After the Presentation we had a feedback session from our tutors, They were very supportive and they liked they way I presented myself to the class.
          I can improve on adding more materials to my matter and make it simple within the given time-limit.

        <p class="text-justify">
          Our Team collaborated well with each other we all had great communication skills and we wanted everyone to listen and Engage to our topic. We are just still getting to know each other
          and with collaboration like this we will understand each other pros and cons will orgranise ourselves according to it. We have our tutors to support us we will reflect on their feedback 
          and follow their guideline throughout the subject to improve myself and improve the team work as well.

          <b>Proof of our work togther are given bellow</b> I collaborated in the team work by making my topic introduction slide (SLIDE 3), put memes and decorations for the slides <b>(Gabe Newell, Reddit, Wanted Posters)</b>, attended group meetings
          and Practiced presentation together to so that we correct each other and speak within the timelimit.

        <br>

        <p class="text-justify">In this week we also had to make a <a style="font-weight:bold">static portfolio website</a> which is <a style="color: red" href="https://VishalUniyal.github.io">this website</a>.
        It was not a difficult task at all because at first it is a static website and it is really easy to make it if you know the basics of HTML and how it works.
        I also have been developing multiple websites for my reference and for my work so it was pretty easy and quick for me by using my past experiences. I also helped my team member
        Andy Lee to setup exactly similar formatted portfolio website and publish it on github pages. <span style="color:red">So don't be surprised ðŸ˜€.</span> Tutors were very supportive, Darsh gave ideas of where 
        and what I can do to improve my ePortfolio.
      </p>

        <p class="text-justify">I took the web template from startbootstrap.com where they had amazing templates for porfolios, This is the template I used <a style="color: red" href="https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/">CLICK HERE</a>.
        I was pretty comfortable using the template and I used the pre-existing tools I had for version controlling like GitKraken Client. Visual Studios Code for text editing and Go Live to run
        local live servers and testing it as the same time.

        <h3 class="md-8">OWASP CTF</h3>
        <p class="text-justify"> OWASP is a really fun activity, I have never done something like it before. By the time Darsh our Tutor introduced us to this activity, Jason already saw and cracked most
        of the problems on the website. So to practise I downloaded Node.js and ran the node server on my windows Powershell to did the activity all by myself to get a feel to what is this CTF game is like.

        <p style="font-weight:bold">ARTIFACT 4 : My achievements till now</p>

        <p class="text-justify">The tutors are really helpful, they put all the useful cyber security related material on the group chat, and give us feed back after every sprint session for us to reflect and 
        improve on. Till now my experience with this subject is very energetic, enjoyable and hear about the future activities from Larry and Darsh I am really excited to be part of Cyber Security Summer Studios.</p>
