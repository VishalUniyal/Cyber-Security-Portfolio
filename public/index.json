It had been a great experience with the subject so far, I had been involved in fixing my website, working on challenges on PentesterLab, Juice-shop, Hackthebox.eu, writing and researching blogs such as hackerOne, BugsCrowd and working out the real life issues with the security in a company\u0026rsquo;s online network and the various ways it can be exploited. This week I also learnt to manage my time between classes, work and homework as I was actively involved in everything that made me miss-out on some key points at my classwork activities that I had to do. I will be explaining more about these in this reflection.\nOn Monday I was involved in working on researching BugCrowd and HackerOne to write, How ethical hacking and bug bounties are impacting stakeholders and How you can implement things you\u0026rsquo;ve learnt throughout the week to test web apps under a responsible disclosure program. Which I have described it in here - Ethical Hacking Blog. I have got the responsible disclosure concept of disclosing information such as bugs or vulnerabilities of the company by reporting to the company first before taking anyother actions. I haven\u0026rsquo;t have much of experience in vulnerability exploiting that I can go ahead to find vulnerabilities for a company and report them, but in future I will become capable and I will surely keep in mind some of the main points I have gathered for responsible disclosure of any vulnerablities of any site (SLO 1) -\n Respect the privacy and not destroy people’s data. NEVER impact other users with your testing. Not to disclose the bugs to public unless a mutual agreement is made with the security team of that company. I will document the report in detail of how I exploited the bug so that it will be easier for the company to analyse and fix the bug. Respect other Bug hunters and respect company policies on any platform you are bug hunting and reporting. Take company’s consent before trying hacking their network or website. Always go through their, privacy and Terms and Conditions before performing any actions on live company network.  Portfolio Website Issues SLO 4\nnthlyufjglf At week 1 I was able to create a website to write my blogs on gitlab but the website was a static website with no generator and basically hardcoded, which takes all the functionalities of basic generator website. Larry and Darsh told me that I will have to recreate my website with a generator in it. On Wednesday I sat down with Andy Lee to search options that we can use to create a generator website. We decided to use Jekyll to run our website, we were warned by other students that it will be a very challenging and we will be needing the right tools to get it working. But me and Andy took the challenge and sat down after class to install that framework. The other students like Jacob Ko, Frank Peng and Max were right about it. It became really hard and annoying, when we were just at the end of running the local server at our computer but the Jekyll framework kept on failing. We Finally decided to use Hugo, I still wanted to run Jekyll but I started installing Hugo and help Andy get his website up and running first. SLO 3\nAfter successful installation of local server on Andy's machine (SLO 3) I had to prepare for my capstone project for the next day so I called it a day and went home. Frank Helped Andy to get the his protfolio website Live using Github. It was very generous of Andy to send me steps to publish my hugo website online. For some reason my website was still not publishing so the next day on Friday I asked Frank whether he can help me publish it. He was a great help as he setup my repository on gitlab and showed excatly what was going wrong in my steps. He pointed the address and the pipline I am using incorrect which was leading to failiure. If I hadn't known Frank and collaborated with other people I would have stuck with fixing Jekyll. (SLO 4)  Artifact 1: Errors Before my setup\n Artifact 2: Successful running after collaborting with Frank and Andy\nSLO 4 ^\nSolving Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges I have been solving Pentester Labs Examples,solving some of various methods a I can use XSS scripts and SQL injection to Hack into the and Exploit data. The example website gives you hint but not full solution which makes me logical reason how to go about exploit information and solving the basic myths of 1=1\u0026rsquo; if the that works.\n Artifact 3: XSS Exploit using \u0026ldquo;Image\u0026rdquo; tag\n Artifact 4: SQL Injection code to generate the next ID\nSLO 2 \nCracking Hackbox Website Invite code When I heard of the website I searched it up and It had a invite code, I was sceptical that people will provide me a invite code. The website being for hackers, I guess I would have to \"Invite Myself\". I opened the Inspect element and spammed the submit button and I got a code, which I decrypted asked me to do a Post to a address. So I looked up google to how to do a post on PowerShell, and I did post with the given code bellow. curl -v -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \\ -d '{}' https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite/api From this I was able to get the actual invite code and I was able to get the invite code decrypted and I was able to login. This feeling was one of the greatest achievement for me, I felt like an actual hacker, I felt good and I wanted to do more of CTF challenges but before I practise on PentesterLab it gave me more logical questioning power that pushed me to unexpected solutions and results which were sucessful.  Artifact 5: InviteCode Hacking\n Artifact 6: Cracked code Using Powershell Curl\n Artifact 6: Finding the code Through decrypting\nSLO 2 \u0026 3 ^\n\nReflection from Feedback and Research SLO 5\nLarry, Darsh and Luke have been really great help in providing me and the class feedback, providing resources to become a better at cyber Security, they are always engaging, friendly and polite with everyone. They are very sincere tutors and helpful especially when I had many work, interview related engagement this week. They gave me time to catch up with my work. From the previous week feedback I have to stick to my topic while I have giving my presentation, ask as many questions to understand my course and homework better. Be more engaging and collaborative in the class.\nHowever this week I tried my best to catch up with the class but I still haven\u0026rsquo;t met the key reflective points just yet. Now I know where I should have a look at the Microsoft teams often to get more Information on what I should be contributing and should work toward the assignment before coming to the class. I will be able to manage my time better to be more collabortive in my class and Acheive better in my tutorials. Being collaborative helping others, people like Frank, Andy and Jacob giving me insights on my work and putting up a helping hand motivates me to work more towards cyber security and cracking CTF challenges to increase my knowlegde and Logical reasoning.\nSLO 5 ^\n\nReferences HackerOne, \u0026ldquo;Disclosure Guidelines\u0026rdquo;.

Application testing is conducted to identify security flaws introduced in the design, implementation or deployment of an application. Developers and application administrators must identify functions that are critical to security and test those functions to verify correct operation.\nProblem Statement #1 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a fairly widespread input sanitization failure (essentially a special case of common mistake #1). An attacker gives your web application JavaScript tags on input. When this input is returned to the user unsensitized, the user’s browser will execute it. It can be as simple as crafting a link and persuading a user to click it, or it can be something much more sinister. On page load the script runs and, for example, can be used to post your cookies to the attacker. Prevention: There’s a simple web security solution: don’t return HTML tags to the client. This has the added benefit of defending against HTML injection, a similar attack whereby the attacker injects plain HTML content (such as images or loud invisible flash players) – not high-impact but surely annoying. Usually, the workaround is simply converting all HTML entities, so that script is returned as \u0026amp;ltscript\u0026amp;gt. The other often employed method of sanitization is using regular expressions to strip away HTML tags using regular expressions on \u0026lt; and \u0026gt;, but this is dangerous as a lot of browsers will interpret severely broken HTML just fine. Better to convert all characters to their escaped counterparts.\nProblem Statement #2 – SQL Injection Injection flaws result from a classic failure to filter untrusted input. It can happen when you pass unfiltered data to the SQL server (SQL injection), to the browser (XSS) to the LDAP server (LDAP injection), or anywhere else. The problem here is that the attacker can inject commands to these entities, resulting in loss of data and hijacking clients’ browsers. Anything that your application receives from untrusted sources must be filtered. Prevention: protecting against injection is “simply” a matter of filtering your input properly and thinking about whether an input can be trusted. But the bad news is that all input needs to be properly filtered, unless it can unquestionably be trusted. Review the OWASP guidelines. Identify those potential vulnerabilities that may apply to your web application. Review your code and test your application to ensure that your application is not vulnerable. (See the Related Procedures and Resources section below for the link to more detailed information about these software vulnerabilities.) Using XSS and SQL injects examples to practise ways of injection can be performed on a fairly vulnerable website. XSS is very easy to exploit in Juice-shop CTF website. I was able to get admin access to the website and was able to change terms and conditions that were given on the Juice-shop website. It also gave me a list of all user credentials via SQL Injection. This shows website is returning a HTML tags to The client and it is not sanitising the script expression and also not SQL scripts. If the apply the above prevention system, it will really hard to crack it next time. Related Procedures and Resources: Campus Standards and Practices  IT / Information Security Exception Request Process Vulnerability Assessment and Management Standard Information Asset Risk Level Definition  How do these issues effect a business?  Today\u0026rsquo;s increasingly complex software development environment requires elegant and comprehensive solutions. Developers must juggle numerous tools and technologies while producing code that performs at the level of digital business. Teams must address an array of issues, including coding to APIs, mobile, and cloud environments. Too many tools lack the flexibility required for developers and many also come with a steep learning curve.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s essential to adopt tools that detect application security vulnerabilities and integrate risk data and metrics in an automated fashion. Organizations that introduce an integrated approach to security and build protection into their SDLC can reduce risk, trim costs, and speed development. They’re able to develop new applications and continuously update existing software without sacrificing security.\nMore Solutions : Embedding Security Testing into Your SDLC\nUnit Testing All security-sensitive code should have a corresponding test suite which verifies that every outcome of every security decision works properly. It greatly improves the odds of catching vulnerabilities before they emerge as actual breaches. Black Box Testing\nIt is a critical component for application security — and it’s an integral part of a SDLC framework. The black box analysis searches inside debug code, directories, leftover source code, and resource files to find SQL strings, ODBC connectors, hidden passwords or usernames, and other sensitive information that malicious individuals could use to hack an application. White Box Testing\nThe ability to find and fix coding vulnerabilities promptly is nothing less than critical. Veracode\u0026rsquo;s white box test solution uses static analysis to spot common flaws without actually executing the software. As the digital age matures and as software code becomes part of every product, service, and business process, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that there\u0026rsquo;s a strong need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to application security. A business and security framework that revolves around a software development lifecycle is all about dollars and sense.\nREFERENCES https://security.calpoly.edu/content/standards/web-app-vulnerabilities?fbclid=IwAR18jbTchzMceIOjAe4R2JKCwF4ajl3RREdxGJdoeE_-XRnMkrUDuYTG7Bs\nhttps://www.toptal.com/security/10-most-common-web-security-vulnerabilities?fbclid=IwAR2hT8UREHqvjUrfKRsOV_02Bz1xZI3LzuH-XEX3PQpSx05-s9aSiVWYimE\nhttps://www.veracode.com/security/software-development-lifecycle?fbclid=IwAR2U0vMWPSX4KHPdw05LGT90p-JHXwPXFgpfrxDleXFnzoOm7fPrpCdOFo8\n","permalink":"https://VishalUniyal.gitlab.io/blog/week2friday/","tags":["xss","Bug Bounty","HackerOne","CI/CD pipelines","agile","Culture"],"title":"Week 2 HomeWork 2 : Problem Statement on Web-application Security"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\n","permalink":"https://VishalUniyal.gitlab.io/blog/week3blog/","tags":["xss","Bug Bounty","HackerOne","CI/CD pipelines","agile","Culture"],"title":"Week 3 Reflection: Problem Statement on Web-application Security"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\nEthical hacking and bug bounties are becomming popular these days, and they are getting paid well for this job. Professtional Ethical Hackers working for big organisations are responsible to test break into the company and systems and develop reports to fix these issue. Where as Bug Bounty hunters are individuals or group of people who find ways to break into company\u0026rsquo;s network and report it to the company they hacked, where they get paid as Bounty.\nThese have great influence on the company and the people who benefit. It greatly minimises the attacks that one organisation is vulnerable to. A whole new cyber security department is being setup for the organisation, multiple roles are being created such as Cyber Security Engineer, Network Analyst etc. Thus creating more opportunities for people who are persuing roles in C.S. Cyber Security has become the new upcoming job market.\n Very Informative Lecture on Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosure\nBug Bounty hunters have to follow a responsible disclosure procedure so that they release a organisation\u0026rsquo;s network/framework vulnerablilities safely to the organisation with/without going public. Going public with the new finding could lead to premature attacks to the company and the people who discovered the bug can be blamed for. A researcher can only disclose a vulnerablity if his report was ignored, or it was not fixed or they felt letting the public know about it will enable the company to fix it, or they are afraid of any legal actions that will be taken against them.\n Local hosting and testing is one of the ideal testing ways to get started.\nWhenever I break into the network or if I find any bugs\nRespect the privacy and not destroy people’s data. NEVER impact other users with your testing. Not to disclose the bugs to public unless a mutual agreement is made with the security team of that company. I will document the report in detail of how I exploited the bug so that it will be easier for the company to analyse and fix the bug.

I am in a five-year Engineering Degree programme to include Diploma in Engineering Practice. As a student I am still finding my career \"End Goal\", and I like familiarising myself with multiple disciplines of computer Software and Security.  I have experience of working for software companies as an Application/Website Developer and Quality Assurance - Internship. I worked on Developing/Testing the structure of the website and automating processes. I collaborated with team and especially the client to deliver solutions to their problems.\nCyber Security as a career is something I look forward to. Now Cyber Security is a big aspect of our lives and also for businesses that rely on digital markets. I have studied subject like Fundamentals of Security, Cyber Security and Digital Forensics which were very interesting and helped me familiarise with some of the widely used offensive security tools and types of attacks. I got to use Kali Linux where I got to use tools like Metasploit, Aircrack-ng and Nmap.\nFrom the Cyber Security Summer Studios Classes I wish to : 1. Develop me technical knowledge and Analytical skills on Cyber Security Issues\n2. Collaborate with my team and gain knowledge from experienced veterans of Cyber Security fields\n3. Reflect of my skills and improve on them from over time\n Softwares I have previously familarised myself with:   My contribution towards this subject : 1.

Reflection  Sprint 1 The First week Of Summer Studios was really great, This one of the few subjects in my degree where I enjoy learning and collaborating with teammates. Almost everyone knew each other in the class, but they welcomed me into their group. I ended up joining a group with mixed major backgrounds but we all share the same goal, to get most of our Cyber Security classes, get a job in this field and have enjoy our tutorial classes. I am happy to be around with very experienced veterans who are also from UTS Cyber Security Society like Jason in my team and also members from other groups are also very helpful. Tutors of our class are very experienced individuals and the knowledge give us about the subject are very informative and intriguing.  IMAGE 1 : We created our Sprint group on Microsoft teams using Microsoft Sprint Board to Allot task to group members for the 1st Presentation. SLOs 1 \u0026 4 Microsoft Teams acted as like a Agile methodology board where we set and assign tasks to people involved in the scrum. We added links to the topics we can prepare our presentation on and the comments with links to the presentation for easy access to others. We had problems deciding the topics and allotting time for each member to contribute speaking on the presentation. In the end we decided to take up Bug Bounty, Arthem Mackwosky who is a Bug Bounty hunter gets paid for finding flaws in steam frameworks. After the Presentation we had a feedback session from our tutors, They were very supportive and they liked they way I presented myself to the class. I can improve on adding more materials to my matter and make it simple within the given time-limit. gb de Our Team collaborated well with each other we all had great communication skills and we wanted everyone to listen and Engage to our topic. We are just still getting to know each other and with collaboration like this we will understand each other pros and cons will orgranise ourselves according to it. We have our tutors to support us we will reflect on their feedback and follow their guideline throughout the subject to improve myself and improve the team work as well. Proof of our work togther are given bellow I collaborated in the team work by making my topic introduction slide (SLIDE 3), put memes and decorations for the slides (Gabe Newell, Reddit, Wanted Posters), attended group meetings and Practiced presentation together to so that we correct each other and speak within the timelimit.   Website 1: Our Topic for Presentation\nPresentation 1: Have a look at our presentation slides HERE (Sprint 1).\nSLOs 2 \u0026 3 In this week we also had to make a static portfolio website which is this website. It was not a difficult task at all because at first it is a static website and it is really easy to make it if you know the basics of HTML and how it works. I also have been developing multiple websites for my reference and for my work so it was pretty easy and quick for me by using my past experiences. I also helped my team member Andy Lee to setup exactly similar formatted portfolio website and publish it on github pages. So don't be surprised 😀. Tutors were very supportive, Darsh gave ideas of where and what I can do to improve my ePortfolio. I took the web template from startbootstrap.com where they had amazing templates for porfolios, This is the template I used CLICK HERE. I was pretty comfortable using the template and I used the pre-existing tools I had for version controlling like GitKraken Client. Visual Studios Code for text editing and Go Live to run local live servers and testing it as the same time. ARTEFACT 1 : Using GitKraken for VCS\nARTEFACT 2 :Using Visual Studios for Code Editing and Running the server (Go Live)\nOWASP CTF OWASP is a really fun activity, I have never done something like it before. By the time Darsh our Tutor introduced us to this activity, Jason already saw and cracked most of the problems on the website. So to practise I downloaded Node.js and ran the node server on my windows Powershell to did the activity all by myself to get a feel to what is this CTF game is like. ARTIFACT 3 : Node.js Server for OWASP Juice Websites.\nARTIFACT 4 : My achievements till now\nThe tutors are really helpful, they put all the useful cyber security related material on the group chat, and give us feed back after every sprint session for us to reflect and improve on. Till now my experience with this subject is very energetic, enjoyable and hear about the future activities from Larry and Darsh I am really excited to be part of Cyber Security Summer Studios.\n   ","permalink":"https://VishalUniyal.gitlab.io/blog/week2blog/","tags":["xss","Bug Bounty","HackerOne","CI/CD pipelines","agile","Culture"],"title":"Week 1 : SUMMER STUDIOS CYBER SECURITY: AN OFFENSIVE MINDSET"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps.
